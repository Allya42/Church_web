    <h1>About Our Church</h1>
    <p>Salvation Church is more than just a place of worship 
      it's a family where faith comes alive and lives are transformed.
      Rooted in the love of Christ, our mission is to bring hope, healing,
      and spiritual growth to every person who walks through our doors.
      We believe in practical Christianity, where the Word of God is lived out daily through service,
     compassion, and community. From powerful worship and inspiring sermons to active outreach programs,
     Salvation Church is committed to raising leaders, nurturing talents, and spreading the message of God’s grace.
     Here, every soul matters, and every testimony is a reminder that God is still at work in the lives of His people.</p>
